# Integrating Patch Manager with AWS Security Hub<a name="security-hub-integration"></a>

AWS Security Hub provides a comprehensive view of security alerts across AWS\. It aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services and partner tools\. This reduces the effort of collecting and prioritizing security findings across accounts\.

When you integrate Patch Manager with Security Hub, Security Hub monitors the patching posture of your fleets from a security point of view\. You can also run automated, continuous account\-level configuration and compliance checks to identify specific accounts and resources requiring attention\. You can view the security findings across accounts to see the current security and compliance status using the integrated dashboard\. 

Using Amazon CloudWatch Events, you can receive alerts when Security Hub detects that instances in your fleet are out of compliance\.

For more information about Security Hub, see the *AWS Security Hub User Guide*\.

There is a charge to use Security Hub\. For more information, see [Security Hub pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/pricing/)\.
